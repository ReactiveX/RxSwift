## Combination operators

Operators that work with multiple source Observables to create a single Observable.


### `startWith`

Return an observeble which emits a specified item before emitting the items from the source Observable.

/*:
### `combineLatest`

Takes several source Obserbables and a closure as parameters, returns an Observable which emits the latest items of each source Obsevable,  procesed through the closure.
Once each source Observables have each emitted an item, `combineLatest` emits an item every time either source Observable emits an item.
