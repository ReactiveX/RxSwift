# Introduction

## Why use RxSwift?

A vast majority of the code we write involves responding to external events. When a user manipulates a control, we need to write an `@IBAction` handler to respond. We need to observe notifications to detect when the keyboard changes position. We must provide closures to execute when URL sessions respond with data. And we use KVO to detect changes to variables.
All of these various systems makes our code needlessly complex. Wouldn't it be better if there was one consistent system that handled all of our call/response code? Rx is such a system.
 
 RxSwift is the official implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io) (aka Rx), which exist for [most major languages and platforms](http://reactivex.io/languages.html).

 ## Concepts
 
 **Every `Observable` instance is just a sequence.**
 
 The key advantage for an `Observable` sequence vs. Swift's `Sequence` is that it can also receive elements asynchronously. _This is the essence of RxSwift._ Everything else expands upon this concept.

 * An `Observable` (`ObservableType`) is equivalent to a `Sequence`.
 * The `ObservableType.subscribe(_:)` method is equivalent to `Sequence.makeIterator()`.
 * `ObservableType.subscribe(_:)` takes an observer (`ObserverType`) parameter, which will be subscribed to automatically receive sequence events and elements emitted by the `Observable`, instead of manually calling `next()` on the returned generator.
 */
/*:
 If an `Observable` emits a next event (`Event.next(Element)`), it can continue to emit more events. However, if the `Observable` emits either an error event (`Event.error(ErrorType)`) or a completed event (`Event.completed`), the `Observable` sequence cannot emit additional events to the subscriber.

 Sequence grammar explains this more concisely:

 `next* (error | completed)?`

 And this can also be explained more visually using diagrams:

 `--1--2--3--4--5--6--|----> // "|" = Terminates normally`

 `--a--b--c--d--e--f--X----> // "X" = Terminates with an error`

 `--tap--tap----------tap--> // "|" = Continues indefinitely, such as a sequence of button taps`

 ### Observables and observers (aka subscribers)
 
 `Observable`s will not execute their subscription closure unless there is a subscriber. In the following example, the closure of the `Observable` will never be executed, because there are no subscribers:
 */
example("Observable with no subscribers") {
    _ = Observable<String>.create { observerOfString -> Disposable in
        print("This will never be printed")
        observerOfString.on(.next("ðŸ˜¬"))
        observerOfString.on(.completed)
        return Disposables.create()
    }
}
/*:
 ----
 In the following example, the closure will be executed when `subscribe(_:)` is called:
 */
example("Observable with subscriber") {
  _ = Observable<String>.create { observerOfString in
            print("Observable created")
            observerOfString.on(.next("ðŸ˜‰"))
            observerOfString.on(.completed)
            return Disposables.create()
        }
        .subscribe { event in
            print(event)
    }
}
/*:
 > Don't concern yourself with the details of how these `Observable`s were created in these examples. We'll get into that [next](@next).
 #
 > `subscribe(_:)` returns a `Disposable` instance that represents a disposable resource such as a subscription. It was ignored in the previous simple example, but it should normally be properly handled. This usually means adding it to a `DisposeBag` instance. All examples going forward will include proper handling, because, well, practice makes _permanent_ ðŸ™‚. You can learn more about this in the [Disposing section](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md#disposing) of the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md).
