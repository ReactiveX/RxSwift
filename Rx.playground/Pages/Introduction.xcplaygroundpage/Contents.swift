# Introduction

## Why use RxSwift?

A vast majority of the code we write revolves around responding to external actions. When a user manipulates a control, we need to write an @IBAction to respond to that. We need to observe Notifications to detect when the keyboard changes position. We must provide blocks to execute when URL Sessions respond with data. And we use KVO to detect changes in variables.
All of these various systems makes our code needlessly complex. Wouldn't it be better if there was one consistent system that handled all of our call/response code? Rx is such a system.

 ### Concepts
 
 The key to understanding RxSwift is by understanding the notion of Observables as **sequences** of elements.
 The next step is to learn how to **create** them, **manipulate** them, and finally **subscribe** to them. Subscribing is needed in order to start the computation and the reception of the elements.
 If an Observable emits an `Event.Next` (an element of the sequence), it can still send events. However, if the Observable emits an `Event.Error` (the Observable sequece terminates with an error) or `Event.Completed` (the Observable sequence has completed without error), the Observable won't ever emit more events.
 
 Sequence grammar explains this more concisely.
 
 `Next* (Error | Completed)?`
 
 
 ## Subscription to Observables sequences
 
 
  Creating an Observable is one thing, but if nothing subscribes to the observable then nothing will happen. In other words, an arbitrary number of `Next` events (sequence elements) will only be emitted after at least one subscription has been made. No more events will be produced after an `Error` or `Completed` has been emitted.
 
 The following closure of the Observable will never be called:
 */

_/* : Observable<String>*/ = Observable<String>.create { observerOfString -> Disposable in
    print("This never will be printed")
    observerOfString.on(.Next("ðŸ˜¬"))
    observerOfString.on(.Completed)
    return NopDisposable.instance
}

/*:
 
 However, the closure in the following is called:
 */

_/* : Disposable*/ = Observable<String>.create { observerOfString -> Disposable in
    print("Observable creation")
    observerOfString.on(.Next("ðŸ˜‰"))
    observerOfString.on(.Completed)
    return NopDisposable.instance
    }
    .subscribe { print($0) }

/*:
 
 So the *subscription* will be present in the whole Rx.playground to prove cases.
 
 > One note to add: It can be seen that the entity returned by `subscribe` is a `Disposable`. In the whole Rx.playground it is not asigned but in a real use case (normaly in most cases) it should be added to a DispodeBag. You can find more information about this in section *Disposing* of *GettingStarted.md* in *Documentation* directory.
