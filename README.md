## About Rx

Rx is a [generic abstraction of computation](https://youtu.be/looJcaeboBY) expressed through `Observable<Element>` interface.

This is a Swift version of [Rx](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET).

It tries to port as many concepts from the original version as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/OSX environment.

Cross platform documentation can be found on [ReactiveX.io](http://reactivex.io/).

Like the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event/data streams.

KVO observing, async operations and streams are all unified under [abstraction of sequence](Documentation/GettingStarted.md#observables-aka-sequences). This is the reason why Rx is so simple, elegant and powerful.

## I came here because I want to ...

###### ... understand

* [why to use rx?](Documentation/Why.md)
* how RxSwift works? [Getting Started Guide](Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
* what is that `Driver`, `ControlProperty`, `Variable` ... and why do they exist? [Units](Documentation/Units.md)
* [the math behind Rx](Documentation/MathBehindRx.md)
* [what are those hot/cold observable sequences?](Documentation/HotAndColdObservables.md)
* [how does the the public API look like](Documentation/API.md)

###### ... install

* Integrate RxSwift/RxCocoa with my app. [Installation Guide](Documentation/Installation.md)

###### ... hack around

* with example app. [Running Example App](Documentation/ExampleApp.md)
* with operators in playgrounds. [Playgrounds](Documentation/Playgrounds.md)

###### ... interact

* All of this is great, but it would be nice to talk with other people using RxSwift and exchange experiences. <br />[![Slack channel](http://slack.rxswift.org/badge.svg)](http://slack.rxswift.org) [Join Slack Channel](http://slack.rxswift.org/)
* Report a problem using the library. [Open an Issue With Bug Template](Documentation/IssueTemplate.md)
* Request a new feature. [Open an Issue With Feature Request Template](Documentation/NewFeatureRequestTemplate.md)


###### ... compare

* [with other libraries](Documentation/ComparisonWithOtherLibraries.md).


###### ... find compatible

* libraries from [RxSwiftCommunity](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity).
* [Pods using RxSwift](https://cocoapods.org/?q=uses%3Arxswift).

###### ... see the broader vision

* Does this exist for Android also? [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* Where is all of this going, what is the future, what about reactive architectures, how do you design entire apps this way? [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-core) - this is javascript, but [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) is javascript version of Rx.
