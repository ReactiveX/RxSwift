/// Represents an observable sequence of elements that share a common key.
/// `GroupedObservable` is typically created by the `groupBy` operator.
/// Each `GroupedObservable` instance represents a collection of elements
/// that are grouped by a specific key.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```
/// let observable = Observable.of("Apple", "Banana", "Apricot", "Blueberry", "Avocado")
///
/// let grouped = observable.groupBy { fruit in
///     fruit.first! // Grouping by the first letter of each fruit
/// }
///
/// _ = grouped.subscribe { group in
///     print("Group: \(group.key)")
///     _ = group.subscribe { event in
///         print(event)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// This will print:
/// ```
/// Group: A
/// next(Apple)
/// next(Apricot)
/// next(Avocado)
/// Group: B
/// next(Banana)
/// next(Blueberry)
/// ```
