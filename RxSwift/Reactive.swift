/**
 Use `Reactive` proxy as customization point for constrained protocol extensions.

 General pattern would be:

 // 1. Extend Reactive protocol with constrain on Base
 // Read as: Reactive Extension where Base is a SomeType
 extension Reactive where Base: SomeType {
 // 2. Put any specific reactive extension for SomeType here
 }

 With this approach we can have more specialized methods and properties using
 `Base` and not just specialized on common base type.

 `Binder`s are also automatically synthesized using `@dynamicMemberLookup` for writable reference properties of the reactive base.
