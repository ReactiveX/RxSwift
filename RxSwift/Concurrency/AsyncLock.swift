In case nobody holds this lock, the work will be queued and executed immediately
on thread that is requesting lock.

In case there is somebody currently holding that lock, action will be enqueued.
When owned of the lock finishes with it's processing, it will also execute

That means that enqueued work could possibly be executed later on a different thread.
