        /**
        If the object is reporting a different class then it's real class, that means that there is probably
        already some interception mechanism in place or something weird is happening.

        The most common case when this would happen is when using a combination of KVO (`observe`) and `sentMessage`.

        This error is easily resolved by just using `sentMessage` observing before `observe`.

        The reason why the other way around could create issues is because KVO will unregister it's interceptor
        class and restore original class. Unfortunately that will happen no matter was there another interceptor
        subclass registered in hierarchy or not.

        Failure scenario:
        * KVO sets class to be `__KVO__OriginalClass` (subclass of `OriginalClass`)
        * `sentMessage` sets object class to be `_RX_namespace___KVO__OriginalClass` (subclass of `__KVO__OriginalClass`)
        * then unobserving with KVO will restore class to be `OriginalClass` -> failure point (possibly a bug in KVO)

        The reason why changing order of observing works is because any interception method on unregistration 
        should return object's original real class (if that doesn't happen then it's really easy to argue that's a bug
        in that interception mechanism).

        This library won't remove registered interceptor even if there aren't any observers left because
        it's highly unlikely it would have any benefit in real world use cases, and it's even more
        dangerous.
