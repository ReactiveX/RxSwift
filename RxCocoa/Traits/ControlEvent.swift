/**
    Trait for `Observable`/`ObservableType` that represents event on UI element.

    It's properties are:

    - it never fails
    - it won't send any initial value on subscription
    - it will `Complete` sequence on control being deallocated
    - it never errors out
    - it delivers events on `MainScheduler.instance`

    **The implementation of `ControlEvent` will ensure that sequence of events is being subscribed on main scheduler
     (`subscribeOn(ConcurrentMainScheduler.instance)` behavior).**

    **It is implementor's responsibility to make sure that that all other properties enumerated above are satisfied.**

    **If they aren't, then using this trait communicates wrong properties and could potentially break someone's code.**

    **In case `events` observable sequence that is being passed into initializer doesn't satisfy all enumerated
     properties, please don't use this unit.**
