/**
 Trait that represents observable sequence with following properties:
 
 - it never fails
 - it delivers events on `MainScheduler.instance`
 - `share(scope: .whileConnected)` sharing strategy

 Additional explanation:
 - all observers share sequence computation resources
 - there is no replaying of sequence elements on new observer subscription
 - computation of elements is reference counted with respect to the number of observers
 - if there are no subscribers, it will release sequence computation resources

 In case trait that models state propagation is required, please check `Driver`.

 `Signal<Element>` can be considered a builder pattern for observable sequences that model imperative events part of the application.
 
 To find out more about units and how to use them, please visit `Documentation/Traits.md`.
