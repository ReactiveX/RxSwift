Rx is a [generic abstraction of computation](https://youtu.be/looJcaeboBY) expressed through `Observable<Element>` interface.

This is a Swift version of [Rx](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET).

It tries to port as many concepts from the original version as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/macOS environment.

Cross platform documentation can be found on [ReactiveX.io](http://reactivex.io/).

Like the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event/data streams.

KVO observing, async operations and streams are all unified under [abstraction of sequence](Documentation/GettingStarted.md#observables-aka-sequences). This is the reason why Rx is so simple, elegant and powerful.

## I came here because I want to ...

###### ... understand

* [why use rx?](Documentation/Why.md)
* [the basics, getting started with RxSwift](Documentation/GettingStarted.md)
* [traits](Documentation/Traits.md) - what are `Single`, `Completable`, `Maybe`, `Driver`, and `ControlProperty` ... and why do they exist?
* [testing](Documentation/UnitTests.md)
* [tips and common errors](Documentation/Tips.md)
* [debugging](Documentation/GettingStarted.md#debugging)
* [the math behind Rx](Documentation/MathBehindRx.md)
* [what are hot and cold observable sequences?](Documentation/HotAndColdObservables.md)

###### ... install

* Integrate RxSwift/RxCocoa with my app. [Installation Guide](#installation)

###### ... hack around

* with the example app. [Running Example App](Documentation/ExampleApp.md)
* with operators in playgrounds. [Playgrounds](Documentation/Playgrounds.md)

###### ... interact

* All of this is great, but it would be nice to talk with other people using RxSwift and exchange experiences. <br />[Join Slack Channel](http://slack.rxswift.org)
* Report a problem using the library. [Open an Issue With Bug Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
* Request a new feature. [Open an Issue With Feature Request Template](Documentation/NewFeatureRequestTemplate.md)
* Help out [Check out contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

###### ... compare

* [with other libraries](Documentation/ComparisonWithOtherLibraries.md).

###### ... understand the structure

RxSwift comprises five separate components depending on eachother in the following way:

```none
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   RxCocoa    ├────▶   RxRelay    │
└───────┬──────┘    └──────┬───────┘
        │                  │        
┌───────▼──────────────────▼───────┐
│             RxSwift              │
└───────▲──────────────────▲───────┘
        │                  │        
┌───────┴──────┐    ┌──────┴───────┐
│    RxTest    │    │  RxBlocking  │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
```

* **RxSwift**: The core of RxSwift, providing the Rx standard as (mostly) defined by [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io). It has no other dependencies.
* **RxCocoa**: Provides Cocoa-specific capabilities for general iOS/macOS/watchOS & tvOS app development, such as Binders, Traits, and much more. It depends on both `RxSwift` and `RxRelay`.
* **RxRelay**: Provides `PublishRelay` and `BehaviorRelay`, two [simple wrappers around Subjects](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/Subjects.md#relays). It depends on `RxSwift`. 
* **RxTest** and **RxBlocking**: Provides testing capabilities for Rx-based systems. It depends on `RxSwift`.

###### ... find compatible

* libraries from [RxSwiftCommunity](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity).
* [Pods using RxSwift](https://cocoapods.org/?q=uses%3Arxswift).

###### ... see the broader vision

* Does this exist for Android? [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* Where is all of this going, what is the future, what about reactive architectures, how do you design entire apps this way? [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-core) - this is javascript, but [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) is javascript version of Rx.

## Requirements

* Xcode 10.2
* Swift 5.0

For Xcode 10.1 and below, [use RxSwift 4.5](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/releases/tag/4.5.0).

## Installation

Rx doesn't contain any external dependencies.

These are currently the supported options:

### Manual

Open Rx.xcworkspace, choose `RxExample` and hit run. This method will build everything and run the sample app

### [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)

```ruby
# Podfile
use_frameworks!

target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
    pod 'RxSwift', '~> 5'
    pod 'RxCocoa', '~> 5'
end

# RxTest and RxBlocking make the most sense in the context of unit/integration tests
target 'YOUR_TESTING_TARGET' do
    pod 'RxBlocking', '~> 5'
    pod 'RxTest', '~> 5'
end
```

Replace `YOUR_TARGET_NAME` and then, in the `Podfile` directory, type:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Officially supported: Carthage 0.33 and up.

Add this to `Cartfile`

```
github "ReactiveX/RxSwift" ~> 5.0
```

```bash
$ carthage update
```

#### Carthage as a Static Library

Carthage defaults to building RxSwift as a Dynamic Library. 

If you wish to build RxSwift as a Static Library using Carthage you may use the script below to manually modify the framework type before building with Carthage:

```bash
carthage update RxSwift --platform iOS --no-build
sed -i -e 's/MACH_O_TYPE = mh_dylib/MACH_O_TYPE = staticlib/g' Carthage/Checkouts/RxSwift/Rx.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
carthage build RxSwift --platform iOS
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

Create a `Package.swift` file.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "RxTestProject",
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift.git", from: "5.0.0")
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "RxTestProject", dependencies: ["RxSwift", "RxCocoa"])
  ]
)
```

```bash
$ swift build
```

To build or test a module with RxTest dependency, set `TEST=1`.

```bash
$ TEST=1 swift test
```

### Manually using git submodules

* Add RxSwift as a submodule

```bash
$ git submodule add git@github.com:ReactiveX/RxSwift.git
```

* Drag `Rx.xcodeproj` into Project Navigator
* Go to `Project > Targets > Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries`, click `+` and select `RxSwift-[Platform]` and `RxCocoa-[Platform]` targets

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
